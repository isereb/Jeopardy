# Jeopardy
An application that allows users to play Jeopardy game with questions based on a Dota 2, a game I used to love and play when was young. It was one of our assignments in Java 2 class, where we were learning about basics of Java Servlets. I reached the expectations and went above them by extending gameplay and adding modifications to the game flow such as daily double feature, and seamless communication with a server using jQuery and AJAX.
